# project-alpha
Clojure based web application based on [JanusClojure](https://github.com/jramb/JanusClojure)

Many thanks to JÃ¶rg Ramb for providing this very helpful examples.

This will be the foundation of my upcomming web development. It currently provides the framework for client side Clojurescript and serverside clojure based on Ring/Compojure.

At the moment there are only some playground definitions (buttons, button events). Most importantly these illustrate how to interface Clojurescript to Google Closure classes.

A more interesting implementation follows ...

## Usage
### Just run it
1. `git clone git://github.com/linneman/project-alpha.git`
2. `cd project-alpha`
3. load clojure and clojurescript: `lein deps`
4. build javascript app: `./build`
5. start the server: `lein run`
6. open http:/localhost:3000/index.html
